TODO:
package srr into a game installer
add an inventory to freeroam
add wandering speedstinger pack to freeroam or part of quest?
add human class
Add purposes and comments to scripts
button click noises
fix forbidden ice track
allow npcs to get speed boxes!
commented out showing player tags on actual player since it's annoying and there already is a thing at the top that shows your place, you can remove that and the other code later if you want

Other (Future) Ideas:
Create a dragon flight simulator except you can roll sideways and forward
How does fireballs work?
war simulator with characters - you can set waypoints to be enemies and draw lines or maybe triggers to detect others
How does color mask work?

Debugging:
Canvas touch-ups
fix the inefficient code for placement script
Ice Level touch-up
fix having to load all the dragon skin materials
create way that npc dragon can be in water!
